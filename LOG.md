####*There is nobody in the present that has seen what is to come; except me. I've discovered something that is troublesome and awesome in power, but cannot enjoy it. It is a curse, and my part in it has already begun.*

**01/19/2015** - I found a new door today, at the facility I work at, that I have not seen before. There are many doors, rooms, hallways in this massive building. It took me the better part of six months working here as a contractor to be familiar enough to walk around confidently; that is to say, without the fear of getting hopelessly lost and actually have to ask someone for directions (while hiding my contractor badge to pretend I'm a visitor in the proccess). So, naturally, there are always random doors and hallways that I am constantly discovering which I have no information about where they lead to. This has always intrigued me, even as a child. Especially in a place of business, a bit less so in educational buildings for some reason. This door seemed special, becasue it was unlike any I had come across before.

The door was simple, to say the least. Not made from some exotic material or any fancy embossed plates or windows. None of that on this door. It was just a plain metal door which had been painted saddle to match the wall it was set in. This wall was naturally attached to a hallway that I rarenly see anyone going down or coming up from. I am still not sure where it leads, but I have never gone down it until today.

What brought me down this particular hall was seeing a purple pen lying on the floor just in front of the door. I had a particular interest in colored pens at work, especially more unique colors like purple. Just before picking up the pen, I casually looked around to make sure nobody saw me bending over. After claiming the prize, I straightened and looked squarely at the door for the first time. I had noticed it before walking down, but paid little attention to it as my eye was on the pen. The door had a, somewhat small for its size, label on it that read:

```
Brooms & Misc - KEEP OUT
```

Except the & sign was backwards. This is what initially intrieged me about the door. Before anyone noticed, I left the hallway and went back to my cube to continue work. The new door was on my radar now, and I was determined to go back to see if it was locked. The "KEEP OUT" would indicate that it was not a locking door. Brooms can't be all that interesting, but "Misc" is always very interesting to me. I'll plan to go there tomorrow.


**01/21/2015** - I was unable to get back to the door yesterday due to a high workload. Today I had extra time so I went down there after eating a hurried lunch to investigate. The hallway, again, was empty. I was nervous as soon as my hand touched the doornob. It was unlocked! I then immediately heard a noise to my right that sounded like someone coughing. Quickly, and without looking too suspicious, I turned and acted like I was just walking dow the hallway. Now that I know it is an unlocked door, I can go back whenever I'd like.
